# Buckwheat

A TypeScript assertion library for writing useful unit tests faster.

Key features:
- Typesafe
- Write expectations on complex objects, thanks to smart matcher composition
- Precise blaming
- Copy-safe

Non-goal

Not a validation library for validating user input or input passed to an API. Buckwheat is only meant to be used in unit tests.
